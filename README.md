# CUCM-API-GUI-Interface
This is an excel VBA macro using a Form and hiding the excel sheet to emulate a GUI Program. I know this seems silly but it makes importing a code base into a secure system very easy as it has no outside dependencies at all. Also, since it is "just" an Excel sheet it doesn't need to go though a software approval process.
